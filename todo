Quickshare Server:
    # Handle Slow Downs
    * Cache x bytes of incoming file
    * Each client has a count to file and only delete cache once all 
        receving clients have gotten all the data
    
    * Hold a queue of waiting to connect clients
    
    # Database (Redis or RocksDB?)
    * Redo SQLite3 database
        * Sqlite3 uses a UUID or hash to as key for clients
        * Sqlite3 stores client metadata and its key references a server hashtable
        * Server hashtable stores client state, timestamps, fd, etc...
